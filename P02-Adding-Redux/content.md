Redux is a library that manages Application state. The React-Redux library acts as bindings between React and Redux. We will need to install both as dependancies.

# Adding Dependancies

> [action]
>
> Add Redux and React-Redux as a dependency to your project.
>
```bash
$ npm install --save redux react-redux
```

# Add some folders

This next step adds a couple folders to organize your code.

> [action]
>
> Make a folder for Actions: `src/actions`
>
> Then, make a folder for Reducers: `src/reducers`
>
> Finally, make another folder to hold some utility functions: `src/utils`
