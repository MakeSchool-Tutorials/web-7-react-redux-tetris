This tutorial uses React and Redux to recreate the classic 
arcade game Tetris. 

Tetris is a classic arcade game that was originally designed 
and programmed by Russian game designer [Alexey Pajitnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov).
It was released on June 6, 1984.

The game, or one of its many variants, is available for nearly 
every video game console and computer operating system, as well 
as on devices such as graphing calculators, mobile phones, 
portable media players, PDAs, Network music players and as an 
Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes.

Here is what Tetris looked like on an arcade machine in the 
80s.

# Prerequisites 

To complete this tutorial you should have some experience with 
the JavaScript Language and React. 

Some experience working with the command line, including NPM 
and Node. 

# Introduction 

The goal of the project is to recreate the classic arcade game
Tetris with React and Redux. 

React will generate and manage the views in the project while 
the state of the game will be stored in Redux.

The game is conrolled by a nested array that represents the 
grid containging all of the blocks. 

The tutorial will also delve into related topics like CSS, 
CSS Grid, and Flex Box. 

## Concepts Covered

- React 
  - JSX
- Redux 
  - Flux
- JavaScript
  - ES6
  - Array
- CSS
  - Grid
  - Flex Box
  
## conclusion

Tetris is a fun and interesting game that can be reacted with 
arrays. This tutorial will store those arrays and other 
information and manage changes with Redux. 

The game will use React to display the data stored in Redux to 
render the game in the browser. 

The tutorial will also use some advanced CSS techniques like 
CSS Grid and Flex Box to render elements in the browser. 

The project will manage software dependancies with npm and node.
