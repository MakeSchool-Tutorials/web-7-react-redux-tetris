This section sets up the default project using Create React
App. 

# Introduction 

The Create React App starter project is a great place to start 
for any React project. 

## Challenges

Create a default app using Create React App. You can follow 
the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Test your app with `npm start` or `yarn start` to make sure 
everything is working. 

Clean up the default project by removing the header and default
content. In 'App.js' the render method should be rendering 
something like: 

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <header className="App-header">
    <h1 className="App-title">Tetris Redux</h1>
  </header>
  
</div>
```

Since we removed the logo we should remove the import for it: 

`import logo from './logo.svg';`

Make a folder for components: 'src/components'.
