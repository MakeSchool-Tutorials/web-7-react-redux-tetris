1. **Implementing Game Over and Restart**
    1. **Handle the behavior of Controls in relation to the game over state**
    1. **Handle the game over state in the `addBlockToGrid` function to know if the blocks are off the screen**
    1. **Modify `game-reducer` to handle the game over state**
    1. **Modify `game-reducer` to handle the restart state**

If the blocks stack to the top of the screen, it's game over. We need to make sure we can handle this state.

Let's take a closer look at `state`:

- `grid` : An array describing the game board. This contains all of the squares that have been placed. It does not contain the current block that you are controlling.
- `shape` : The index of the current shape that you are controlling. The index identifies the array of shapes for each rotation in the shape array.
- `rotation` : The index of the rotation for the current block.
- `x` : horizontal position of the shape you are controlling.
- `y` : vertical position of the shape you are controlling.
- `nextShape` : index of the next shape that will appear after
the current shape is placed.
- **`isRunning`** : when true, the game is running, false when the
game is paused.
- **`gameOver`** : true when the game is over.
- `speed` : the number of milliseconds before a block is moved down.
- `score` : your score

`isRunning` and `gameOver` are the two important properties for this discussion, let's go over the basic rules of these properties:

- `isRunning` is is set by the Play/Resume button. When `isRunning` is false, the game is paused but not over.
- On the other hand when `gameOver` is true the game is over.
- The controls should not issue actions when `isRunning` is
false or `gameOver` is true.
- The move down action that forces the game along should also
not happen when `isRunning` is false or `gameOver` is true.
- `gameOver` is set to false by default. It gets set to true
when the game is over.
- A game is over when a block is added to the grid and part if that block ends up off the top edge of the grid.

# Handle gameOver in the controls component

Here you need to disable the controls when the `gameOver` property on `state` is false.

> [action]
>
> Use the `useSelector` hook in `/src/components/Controls.js`:
>
> Import useSelector and then get the isRunning and gameOver values from state. 
> 
```js
...
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
...
export default function Controls(props) {
	const dispatch = useDispatch()
	const isRunning = useSelector((state) => state.game.isRunning)
	const gameOver = useSelector((state) => state.game.gameOver) 
>
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

The `onClick` handler for each function should check
`isRunning` and `gameOver`. If `isRunning` is `false`
or `gameOver` is `true` the buttons should not send actions.

> [action]
>
> Update all of the `button` elements in the `return` block of `/src/components/controls.js` to check `isRunning` and `gameOver` before dispatching their actions. 
>
```js
...
>
export default function Controls(props) {
	...
>
	return (
		<div className="controls">
			{/* left */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveLeft())
			}}>Left</button>
>
			{/* right */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveRight())
			}}>Right</button>
>
			{/* rotate */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(rotate())
			}}>Rotate</button>
>
			{/* down */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveDown())
			}}>Down</button>
>
		</div>
	)
}
```

With these changes the controls will not work when the game is paused or over. You haven't solved the game over situation yet, soon! For now when game is paused the blocks should not move or rotate when the controls are used. 

There is a small problem. When the game is paused the buttons look like they should work. Visually they look the same as when the game is not paused.

Button has an attribute: disabled that disables a button when true. 

> [action]
>
> Update `/src/components/controls.js` to check `isRunning` and `gameOver` and set the disabled attribute.
>
```js
...
>
export default function Controls(props) {
  ...
>
	return (
		<div className={`controls`}>
			{/* left */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveLeft())
				}}>Left</button>
>
			{/* right */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveRight())
				}}>Right</button>
>
			{/* rotate */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(rotate())
				}}>Rotate</button>
>
			{/* down */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveDown())
				}}>Down</button>
>
		</div>
	)
}
```
>

With this change in place the buttons should disable as disbaled when the game is paused, `isRunning === false`, or over, `gameOver === false`. 

# Detecting a game over

We can detect a game over in the `addBlockToGrid`
function `utils/index.js`

The `addBlockToGrid()` function adds a block to the grid. If part of the block ends up off the top the grid the game is over.

The goal is to have the function return the new grid and a bool that says the game is over (true) or the game is not over (false). Since we can only return one value from a function, the return type will have to change to an object with two properties: `grid` and `gameOver`.

> [action]
>
> In `/src/utils/index.js`, update `addBlockToGrid` to the following:
>
```JavaScript
// Adds current shape to grid
export const addBlockToGrid = (shape, grid, x, y, rotation) => {
  // At this point the game is not over
  let blockOffGrid = false
  const block = shapes[shape][rotation]
  const newGrid = [ ...grid ]
  for (let row = 0; row < block.length; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < block[row].length; col++) {
      if (block[row][col]) {
        const yIndex = row + y
        // If the yIndex is less than 0 part of the block
        // is off the top of the screen and the game is over
        if (yIndex < 0) {
          blockOffGrid = true
        } else {
          newGrid[row + y][col + x] = shape
        }
      }
    }
  }
  // Return both the newGrid and the gameOver bool                                                
  return { grid: newGrid, gameOver: blockOffGrid }
}
```

Changing this will mean changes to the reducer and the
MOVE_DOWN case where this method is called.

# Modify the game-reducer

> [action]
>
> Modify the MOVE_DOWN case for `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`:
>
```JavaScript
case MOVE_DOWN:
  // Get the next potential Y position
  const maybeY = y + 1
>
  // Check if the current block can move here
  if (canMoveTo(shape, grid, x, maybeY, rotation)) {
      // If so move down don't place the block
      return { ...state, y: maybeY }
  }
>
  // If not place the block
  // (this returns an object with a grid and gameover bool)
  const obj = addBlockToGrid(shape, grid, x, y, rotation)
  const newGrid = obj.grid
  const gameOver = obj.gameOver
>
  if (gameOver) {
    // Game Over
    const newState = { ...state }
    newState.shape = 0
    newState.grid = newGrid
    return { ...state, gameOver: true }
  }
>
  // reset somethings to start a new shape/block
  const newState = defaultState()
  newState.grid = newGrid
  newState.shape = nextShape
  newState.score = score
  newState.isRunning = isRunning
>
  // TODO: Check and Set level
  // Score increases decrease interval
  newState.score = score + checkRows(newGrid)
>
  return newState
```

Try to force a game over and make sure you see the popup:

![gameover](assets/gameover.png)

Almost done! One more feature and we've got a full Tetris game!

# Now Commit

>[action]
>
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'game over implemented'
$ git push
```

# Restart Game-Reducer

Now that the game knows when it's ended, we need a way to restart it!

Restarting the game will only require setting the game `state` in redux back to default, and there already is a function for this!

> [action]
>
> Return default state with a call to `defaultState()` in the `RESTART` case in `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`:
>
```js
case RESTART:
    return defaultState()
```

Try pressing the restart button and make sure it starts the game from a clean slate.

# Now Commit

>[action]
>
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'restart implemented'
$ git push
```

**You have now implemented an advanced single page application with React â€” a fully functioning Tetris game! Congrats!**

As you go through this FEW course, try to tie the concepts you learned here into the course material. The foundational work here on building React apps will be used to make bigger and bolder apps down the road!
