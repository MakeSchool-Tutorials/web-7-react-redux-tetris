Now that the game know when it's ended you need a 
way to restart it. 

# Introduction 

The game state held in Redux is the entire game. 
restarting the game will only require setting the
game state in redux back to default, and there 
already is a function for this! You need to 
implement this at the right location. 

## Challenges

Return default state with a call to `defaultState()`
in the `RESTART` case in 'game-reducer'.
