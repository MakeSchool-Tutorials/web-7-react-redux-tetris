Now that the game know when it's ended you need a 
way to restart it. 

# Introduction 

The game state held in Redux is the entire game. 
restarting the game will only require setting the
stae in redux back to default, and there is a 
function for this. 

## Challenges

Return default state with a call to `defaultState()`
in the `RESTART` case in 'game-reducer'.
